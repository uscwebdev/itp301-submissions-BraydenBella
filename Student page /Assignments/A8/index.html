        <h3>Topic</h3> 
        <p>For my final project I want to be able to make a website that I can use on a daily basis. <br>
        Somthing that I use everyday is Youtube to learn about the latest stats on videogames and other sporting events <br>
        Therefore I'm going to make a "Guilty Pleasure Page" That pulls all the information form these results and gives <br>
        me the TLDR or simple who won each match. The website will also include videos that I can watch via a link <br> 
        and everyday I can log on once and it will refresh for the next day. </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="audience">
        <h3> Intended Audience</h3>
        <p> Intially my intented audeince would be myself and maybe after completion I will show my freinds how the site works<br> 
            and what they can do on it. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="desgin">
        <h3> Design</h3>
        <p> would like the website to me simplistic and straight to the point. Simply put who won each match and a video to accompany it<br>
        if at all possible. Also I would like to include other trackers like how many days till the next competition.</p>I

    <div class="sections">
        <h3>Sections</h3>
        <p> I am planning on having for starters three main compentents to this page. First of which will include the results themeslves. <br>
        then I will include the videos for each in Highlight format. Finally, I will have articles to read about each sport or topic mostly updates. </p>

    <div class="implementation">
        <h3> Functions of the Website</h3>
        <p> I want to learn how to use API's to my advantage. Thefore refrencing certain websites and scraping them for specific infromation is <br> 
        the main feature. This may prove challenging or could not be possible if so I can choose a more simple project like <br> 
    a store front that also provides information about a product that my freinds are selling. </p>
